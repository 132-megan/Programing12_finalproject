# Programing12_finalproject

My project is…… 
My project plan was to create a digital planner using android studios. This changed to be using tkinter.

I was/am curious about this project because….. 
I wanted to learn a bit of java with this project because that is what I will be learning in September at university, this didn’t end up happening to the extent that I wished but I could still learn some over the summer if I want to. I also wanted to create a digital planner that would fit my exact need in hopes that it might be useful in managing my time in university in September.

So far I have learned and completed (Include snippets, Screen Shots and Screen Recordings….. 
I began my project by creating a plan for what I wanted to create, I decided upon a digital planner and planned out all the features I wanted in my notebook. I began creating this app in android studios but progress was consistently very slow, just like the program speed. I decided I would try and stick it out because at the time I was still making progress but I was not getting far enough and when I realized that I wouldn’t have anything significant to show by the time I needed to hand this in I decided to switch to tkinter. Within tkinter my progress was much quicker because I was already slightly familiar with the application and the instructions were far more straight forward. 
I have attached my python tkinter code as well as a video of the application and I attached a video of my android studio project to teams as it was too big to upload to github. I have also attached an image of my initial plan.

Some problems and/or hurdles have been…. 
The entirety of android studios was slow and confusing which made it challenging to progress in there in a timely manner. I ended up switching to tkinter but I switched quite late and didn’t get as much as I had hoped done.

If I had more time the next steps I need to take are…. 
I would add more to my tkinter project continuing to fulfill the plans that I made at the beginning of this project.

My Key Learnings to date are….
I did not expand my knowledge on java as much as I would have liked but in the end I developed a deeper understanding of python and tkinter. I also was able to familiarize myself with more common terms such as containers and parent/child relationships as well as how these terms are used properly and how to implement them.
